# Project Include Site 2021

Created by: [Shabaz Badshah](https://github.com/ShabazBadshah/)
Maintained by: [Shabaz Badshah](https://github.com/ShabazBadshah/)

## Site Goals

This is the official Project Include (PI) site for 2021 (redesigned with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) which focuses on the following four objectives:

1. To provide boost credibility, increase stakeholder/partner interest, and increase brand presence
2. To provide a modern UX/UI experience to visitors
3. Introduce a component-based frontend to allow for easier maintability and scalability by migrating to React
4. Additional performance improvements to run on lower end hardware

This site is an enhancement of the existing [PI site](https://projectinclude.ca). See [jekyll-site-v2 source code](https://github.com/Project-Include/Project-Include.github.io/tree/jekyll-site-v2) for the previous iteration of the site
